# Predicting the survival rate in Heart failure

**GOAL** : Predict the Survival rate in Heart Failures

**INTRODUCTION:** Heart failures occurs when heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in our body. 
One person dies every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the United States. About 655,000 Americans die from Heart disease each year- that is  1 in every 4 deaths according to the recent statistics(September 2020). Further Heart Disease costs US about $219 billion each year as estimated from 2014 to 2015, which includes cost of health care services, medicines and loss of productivity due to death , according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). <br />


This dataset contains 13 variables, namely age, anaemia, creatinine_phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection_fraction, high_blood_pressure, serum_creatinine, serum_sodium, sex, smoking, time and Death_event.

# Object:  The object of this project is to create a model that predicts the survival rate of  heart failures based on the above mentioned variables. 

The tools I  used are Python and the libraries- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

## **DEFINING THE PROBLEM-** <br />

The medical conditions that have impact on heart failures are - Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, obesity and other conditions related to heart. Machine Learning, in particular, can predict the patient's survival using the data such as-  electonic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical laboratory test results. It can also individuate the most important deatures among those included in their medical records. <br />

**PREVENTION :** With the advancement of science and technology and if Heart failure's are diagnosied early,  it can be treated and prevent deaths.

“The very essence of cardiovascular practice is the early detection of heart failure” - Sir Thomas Lewis, 1933
