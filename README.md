# Predicting the survival rate in Heart failure

**GOAL** : Predict the Survival rate in Heart Failures

**INTRODUCTION:** Heart failures occurs when heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in our body. The object of this project is to develop a model that predicts the survival rate of  heart failures based on variables like age, anaemia, creatinine_phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection_fraction, high_blood_pressure, serum_creatinine, serum_sodium, sex, smoking, time and Death_event.

The tools I  used are Python and the libraries- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

## **DEFINING THE PROBLEM-** <br />

One person dies every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the United States. About 655,000 Americans die from Heart disease each year- that is  1 in every 4 deaths as per the recent statistics(September 2020). Further Heart Disease costs US about $219 billion each year as estimated from 2014 to 2015, which includes cost of health care services, medicines and loss of productivity due to death , according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). <br />

The medical conditions that have impact on heart failures are - Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, obesity and other conditions related to heart. Machine Learning, in particular, can predict the patient's survival using the data such as-  electonic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical laboratory test results. It can also individuate the most important features among those included in their medical records. <br />

**PREVENTION :** With the advancement of science and technology, if Heart failure's are diagnosied early,  it can be treated and can increase the survival rate. <br />
“The very essence of cardiovascular practice is the early detection of heart failure” - Sir Thomas Lewis, 1933 <br />

This dataset contains 299 observations and 13 variables.
